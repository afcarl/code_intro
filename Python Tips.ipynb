    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "__Dictionaries__ are a common data type we'll see in Python. Like the more familiar dictionaries, which map a term to a definition, Python's dictionaries map a _key_ (which is just some string) to a _value_ (which can be pretty much anything).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are created using curly braces (`{` and `}`). You put each key-value pair on a separate line, and each line must end with a comma. The key and value are separated by a colon (`:`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dictionary = {\n",
    "    'planets': ['earth', 'mars', 'jupiter'],\n",
    "    'moons': ['luna', 'europa'],\n",
    "    'stars': ['sun']\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, our keys are 'planets', 'moons', and 'stars', and each one points to a list of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access a key in a dictionary like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dictionary['planets'] # this will output ['earth', 'mars', 'jupiter']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also add or update keys in a dictionary like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dictionary['comets'] = ['haley']\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "1. _Split_ the string into words, which will give us a list of words\n",

    "words = my_string.split()\n",
    "\n",

    "counts = Counter(my_words)\n",

    "This is something you'll be doing a lot.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you encounter an error, don't panic -- it's fine! Nothing is irreversibly damaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can approach dealing with errors (called \"debugging\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use this snippet of code as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(foo)\n",
    "\n",
    "'''error:\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n",
    "<ipython-input-1-f69e17766c29> in <module>()\n",
    "----> 1 print(foo)\n",
    "\n",
    "NameError: name 'foo' is not defined\n",
    "'''\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Read the error message.__\n",
    "    - The error message's most informative part is usually at the bottom. Here it says \"NameError: name `foo` is not defined\". This tells us exactly what went wrong.\n",
    "    - The part above this message is the \"Traceback\", which shows us where in the code the error happened.\n",
    "2. __Go back to where your code broke, try to explain it to yourself, and see if you can connect it to the error.__ This is called \"rubber ducking\" (the name comes from explaining your code to a rubber duck) and it can be very helpful in debugging. In this case you might say:\n",
    "    - \"Ok, we want to print a variable named 'foo'\".\n",
    "    - \"The error says `foo` is not defined.\"\n",
    "    - \"Hm...I forgot to set a variable named `foo`. So I should try that.\"\n",
    "3. __Try a solution.__ You're not always going to get it right on the first try. You might not even understand your code well enough to know _what_ to try. The important thing is to just _try_ things. A nice thing about coding is that you don't have to get things right the first time. You can always undo your changes and re-run your code. So if you have an inkling that something might work, don't hesitate to give it a shot.\n",
    "4. __If you really get stuck, copy the error message into Google.__. I promise you this is a big part of learning to program. You'll often find the exact solution you're looking for. Other times you won't find the exact solution, but some insight that will help you out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we just have to change the code to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "foo = 'hello world'\n",
    "print(foo)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we've defined `foo` and everything works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some common errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `NameError`: you're trying to use a variable or function you haven't defined yet.\n",
    "    - This could be because you're using the wrong variable/function name, or have a small typo\n",
    "    - Or you just forgot to define the variable/function (as in the example above)\n",
    "- `SyntaxError`: you've probably forgot a comma, or quote, or parentheses, etc somewhere.\n",
    "- `AttributeError`: you're trying to call a method or access an attribute that doesn't exist\n",
    "    - This could be because you've misspelled the attribute or method name\n",
    "    - Or it doesn't exist (which could be for a variety of reasons)\n",
    "- `KeyError`: you're trying to access a key in a dictionary that doesn't exist\n",
    "    - This could be because you've mispelled the key\n",
    "    - Or you just haven't set the key yet"
