    "\n",
    "Today we're going to experiment with our own bots using _Slack_, a chat room application, and a Python library called _Tracery_, which makes it easy for us to define what the bot should say.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't be creating bots meant to interfere with or influence politics, but we'll encounter many of the same fundamental concepts.\n",

    "    1. Enter your name for \"App Name\"\n",
    "    2. Select \"botfarm\" as the \"Development Slack Workspace\".\n",
    "    3. Click \"Create App\".\n",
    "4. Under \"Add features and functionality\", click \"Bots\".\n",
    "5. Click \"Add a Bot User\".\n",
    "    1. Give it a display name and username of your choice.\n",
    "    2. Replace `<YOUR BOT USERNAME>` below with the bot's username).\n",
    "    3. Click \"Add Bot User\".\n",
    "6. Under the \"Features\" sidebar, click \"OAuth & Permissions\"\n",
    "7. Click \"Install App to Workspace\", then click \"Authorize\".\n",
    "8. On this page, replace the `<YOUR TOKEN>` code below with your \"Bot User OAuth Access Token\".\n",
